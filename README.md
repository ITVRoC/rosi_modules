# rosi_modules

This package contains the medium-level control algorithms for the ROSI platform. It provides the following features:
- An inverse differential kinematics for the chassis: the system accepts linear and angular velocities commands for the chassis frame, and the flippers, tracks and wheels will automatically coordinate to achieve the desired input.
- A chassis attitude controller: it is possible to define an attitude set-point for the chassis, and the controller will automatically manage the flippers lever-joint angular velocity to maintain it.
- A joystick input manager: it provides a joystick interface compatible to the `joy_node' package.
- An external navigation planner manager: it provides a topic for issuing `Twist' commands directly to the chassis frame.
- Gen3 control interface: the Kinova Gen3 manipulator can be embedded on the platform, and this package provides an interface for controlling it using the joystick.
- Four operation modes: (I) joints in manual; (II) inverse differential kinematics with the chassis; (III) chassis attitude controller; (IV) gen3 manipulator command.

More information about the package, installations and under-the-hood information, please see the the WIKI page.
